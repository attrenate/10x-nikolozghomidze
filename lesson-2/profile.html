            <mark>Ive always loved watching movies—theres something about diving into different stories</mark> and exploring how each film captures life in unique ways. 
            I could spend hours getting lost in the plot, trying to figure out whats going to happen next or what the deeper meaning might be. 
            When Im not glued to a screen, youll find me on the basketball court, playing with my friends. 
            The game is an adrenaline rush, but honestly, I enjoy the conversations we have afterward even more, 
            talking about everything from sports strategies to the weird things that happen in life.

            Im all about new experiences too. I love trying out different activities, traveling when I can, or just stepping outside my comfort zone to learn something new. Lately, I’ve gotten really into coding, and it’s become a new passion of mine. There’s something satisfying about creating something from scratch and solving problems along the way. One of my favorite things to do is sit down with my friends and talk about philosophy. We’ll get into all sorts of deep topics—like the meaning of life, fate, and whether we really have control over our choices. Those conversations are always thought-provoking, and I find myself thinking about them long after we’ve finished talking.

            Fun facts

        </h3>
        <p>
            I’m the type of person who can quote entire movie scenes by heart, and I love doing it to make my friends laugh. Whether it’s a classic line or an obscure reference, I’m always ready to drop a perfect quote. A while back, I even tried to build a mini basketball hoop out of popsicle sticks. It didn’t quite work out, but it was a fun experiment. When I’m not watching movies or playing basketball, I’ve been getting really into coding. I taught myself through YouTube tutorials and now spend hours tinkering with new projects, like building simple apps and tracking stats. One of my projects was an app to track game scores and player performance—mixing my love for coding with basketball!

        <p> Travel is also high on my list. I dream of visiting at least three countries in the next five years to experience different cultures through food, music, and traditions. I keep a "philosophy book" where I jot down my thoughts on life and meaningful quotes from all the deep, late-night conversations I have with my friends. And when it comes to basketball, I’m known for pulling off “impossible” trick shots. No one believes I can make them, but somehow, I always do—and my friends can’t help but be amazed.
